# Putting it all together
Final assignment for INFX 598 E

### What this page is
I created this page to have an easy way to keep track of which LEGO Dimensions figures I own, using javascript learned in the Creating Content from Data challenge. The figures are a shared collection between my sister and I, and there have been multiple occasions where we've accidentally bought duplicates. This page replicates a database I had created using a macro-enabled excel sheet. A web page is both shared more easily than the excel document and easier to access from any device. While this collection's relevance has limited use beyond myself, this project is also testing the capabilities of using material design lite to organize a collection as a whole.

### Ideas for future development
* Adding an input or form to add new figures based on their item number, pushing an object from the UNOWNED array into the DIMENSIONS array if user inputs an exact match. For visual simplicity, I would like to tie this to the "Add a Pack" button. This would seem to require a polyfill or a new page, both beyond the time I have for this assignment
* An option to bring up a list of unowned figures, making the visual interface different enough to not be confused with the main collection.
* User log-ins, if only to figure out how to make this concept usuable to others (though a significant roadblock would be navigating the copyright issues surrounding the brand)
