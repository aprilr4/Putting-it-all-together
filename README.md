# Putting-it-all-together
Final assignment for INFX 598 E

### What this page is
I created this page to have an easy way to keep track of which LEGO Dimensions figures I own, using javascript learned in the Creating Content from Data challenge. The figures are a shared collection between my sister and I, and there have been multiple occasions where we've accidentally bought duplicates. This page replicates a database I had created using a macro-enabled excel sheet. A web page is both shared more easily than the excel document and easier to access from any device.

### Ideas for future development
* Adding an input or form to add new figures based on their item number 
* An option to bring up a list of unowned figures, making the visual interface different enough to not be confused with the collection
* User log-ins (if only to figure out how to make this concept usuable to others, though a roadblock would be the copyright issues surrounding the brand.)
