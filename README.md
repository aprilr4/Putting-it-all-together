## What this page is
I created this page to have an easy way to keep track of which LEGO Dimensions figures I own. The figures are a shared collection between my sister and I, and there have been multiple occasions where we've accidentally bought duplicates. This page replicates a database I had created using a macro-enabled excel sheet. A web page is both shared more easily than the excel document and easier to access from any device.

## Ideas for future development
* Adding form to add new figures based on their item number 
* An option to bring up a list of unowned figures.
